# MyRObot
 easyEEZYbotARM on a arduino 
 
 Welcome to our demonstration of using a Python and Arduino controller for the EEZYbotARM Mk1 & Mk2 robotic arm. This robotic arm is capable of 3-D kinematics, which allows it to move and manipulate objects in multiple dimensions.

In this demonstration, we will be showing you an algorithm that allows the EEZYbotARM to pick up and move an object to a different position. This functionality can be applied in a variety of industrial settings, such as shipping and logistics, where the ability to accurately and efficiently move items is crucial. We will be explaining the steps of the algorithm and providing visual examples of the robotic arm in action.
